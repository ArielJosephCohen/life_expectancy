EDA (basic df)

Target Correlation:

Status (percentageexpenditure, GDP, Population, Schooling)
Infant deaths (thinness)
Alcohol (GDP, BMI, schooling, population)
percentageexpenditure (GDP, population, Incomecompositionofresources, schooling)
hepB (bmi, GDP, Incomecompositionofresources)
measles (bmi, GDP, Incomecompositionofresources)
u-5 deaths (thinness, percentageexpenditure)
totalexpenditure (population, GDP, schooling)
GDP (population, Incomecompositionofresources, schooling)

EDA (grouped df named country_df):

Breakdown of status across all countries
Lifeexpectancy leaders and losers and distribution
AdultMortality leaders and losers and distribution
infantdeaths leaders and losers and distribution
Alcohol leaders and losers and distribution
Effect of alcohol on life expectancy by leaders and losers
Effect of schooling on alcohol across countries
Percent and total expenditure leader and loser and distribution and corrleation
Percent expenditure and GDP leader and loser and distribution and corrleation
Hep C leaders losers distribution and connection with other diseases
same with measles, polio, diphtheria, hiv/aids
bmi leaders losers distribution
bmi and schooling correlation
bmi on hiv/aids
schooling distribution leader losers and conneciton to GDP

Feature correlations:

Status (alcohol, populaation, percent expenditure, bmi, hiv, schooling)
percentspent (total expense, GDP, Incomecompositionofresources, schooling)
HepB and other diesease (other dieseases, BMI, schooling)
u-5 (thinness, diseases, infantdeaths)
gdp (pop, thinnes, Incomecompositionofresources, schooling)
pop (Incomecompositionofresources, schooling)
thinness to thinness

Hypotheses to test

does status affect pop, alcohol, diseases, schooling, percentexpenditure?
does alcohol affect or correlate to diseases?
does alcohol affect BMI, GDP, schooling?
does percentexpenditure affect GDP, thinnes, schooling, Incomecompositionofresources?
disease relationships?
total expenditure and percent expenditure?
population on thinness, schooling?
